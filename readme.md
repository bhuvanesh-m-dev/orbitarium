# 🌌 CosmoTalker Orbitarium

> **Where code meets cosmos — explore the universe, one orbit at a time.** 🚀

**CosmoTalker Orbitarium** is the **visual and experiential ecosystem** built around **CosmoTalker**, bringing **orbits, solar systems, and space science** to life through interactive models, simulations, and intelligent tools.

It acts as the **umbrella environment** for all orbit-centric and visualization-driven components in the CosmoTalker ecosystem.

---

## 🧭 What is Orbitarium?

**Orbitarium** is a modular ecosystem designed to unify:

- 🪐 Orbital simulations  
- 🌍 3D Solar System visualizations  
- 🤖 Space-focused intelligence models  
- 🧪 Interactive learning tools for astronomy  

While **CosmoTalker** serves as the **core Python engine**, **Orbitarium** is where that data becomes **visual, interactive, and immersive**.

---

## 🧩 Ecosystem Overview

The CosmoTalker ecosystem is structured into clear, scalable layers:

### 🛰️ CosmoTalker (Core Engine)
- Python library for astronomy and space data
- Offline-first design with search and exploration tools
- Acts as the backbone for all other components

📦 License: **MIT**

---

### 🧠 Oolit (Intelligence Layer)
- Domain-focused model trained for astronomy and space concepts
- Powers reasoning, explanations, and intelligent responses
- Designed specifically for the CosmoTalker ecosystem

📦 License: **CC BY-NC 4.0**

---

### 🪐 Orbitarium (Experience Layer)
- Interactive 3D Solar System and space models
- Orbital motion and visualization
- Browser-based learning experiences

🌐 Live demo:

📦 License: **CC BY-NC 4.0**

---

### 💻 Cosmo4U
- Desktop / platform distribution of CosmoTalker
- Designed to make space education accessible across systems
- Future builds planned for Linux, Windows, and Android

---

## 🌠 Why “Orbitarium”?

The name **Orbitarium** follows established space and science naming conventions:

- *Planetarium* — a place to explore planets  
- *Stellarium* — a place to explore stars  
- **Orbitarium** — a place to explore orbits and celestial systems  

The **“-arium”** suffix represents an **environment or system**, making it ideal for a growing ecosystem of space-focused tools.

---

## 🚀 Vision & Roadmap

Orbitarium is built with long-term expansion in mind:

- 🌌 More celestial systems (exoplanets, satellites)
- ⏱️ Time-based orbital simulations
- 🧑‍🚀 Education-focused visual labs
- 🔑 Public APIs for CosmoTalker & Oolit
- 🥽 Future AR / immersive learning concepts

---

## 📜 Licensing Summary

| Component | License |
|---------|--------|
| CosmoTalker (Python library) | MIT |
| Orbitarium (3D models & visuals) | CC BY-NC 4.0 |
| Oolit model | CC BY-NC 4.0 |

This structure keeps the **core open and developer-friendly**, while allowing sustainable growth and educational use.
